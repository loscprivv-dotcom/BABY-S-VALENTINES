The first time I saw you was on Instagram Live, and I never knew that simple moment would change my whole life. 
We started talking just like that, two strangers getting to know each other, laughing and sharing small pieces of our hearts. 
You were the first one to fall in love, and even though I felt my heart slowly choosing you too, I was too shy to say it.

<br><br>

When we finally met at MSU, seeing you in front of me made everything real. 
That was the day I knew my feelings were no longer small — I was falling for you harder than I ever expected, 
but I still kept it quietly inside my heart.

<br><br>

On 7th October 2023, at our first concert together, you gave me a memory I will cherish forever. 
In the middle of the crowd, with all the noise and lights around us, you chose me and promised to be with me for the rest of your life. 
That moment still plays in my mind like the most beautiful love story.

<br><br>

We have struggled so much because of the people around us. We have argued, we have cried, and sometimes our fights made our love feel heavy. 
But no matter how far we drifted in anger, we always found our way back to each other with the same love, the same longing, the same heartbeat. 
And now it’s 2026 — and we are still here, still holding on, still loving each other just as deeply.

<br><br>

To the man who has my heart, Happy Valentine’s Day, sayang. 
Me sayang you a lot, kannu. More years to go with you, more memories to create, more dreams to build together. 
I want you beside me for the rest of your life, growing, laughing, and loving each other endlessly.

<br><br>

To those who think we won’t last, I want them to see us happy in the future — stronger than ever. 
Be with me, and I will show you the whole world filled with love, loyalty, and forever. 
You are my safe place, my greatest blessing, and my always.

<br><br>

With Love,<br>
Your Baby 🤍
